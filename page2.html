            <div class="I">The iPhone 3G, released in 2008, was a significant evolution from its predecessor, the original iPhone. Building on the foundation laid by the inaugural model, the 3G introduced a crucial advancement - support for 3G cellular networks. This brought a substantial boost in internet speeds, enhancing the browsing and data-intensive capabilities of the device. The introduction of GPS was another game-changer, allowing users to pinpoint their locations and access location-based services with unprecedented accuracy. The design retained the sleek and iconic look of the original iPhone, but with a glossy plastic back, giving it a distinctive appearance. The iPhone 3G's combination of enhanced connectivity, GPS functionality, and a burgeoning App Store ecosystem solidified its status as a game-changing device, further cementing Apple's dominance in the smartphone market.</div>
